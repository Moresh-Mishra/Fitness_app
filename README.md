# Fitness_app
A fitness app with dynamic web login and static chart.js
In this particular website we have used the power of html css and js for the frontend
Node.js for backend and connectivity
and MySQL for databases

we have initialized the project with the login page where if the user tries to hit the landing page they get redirected to the login page if they have not logged in already. To authorize and verify the user we have  used jsonwebtoken (jwt)  for generation of token for each indivisual owner
After logging into the website, the user gets redirected to the edit profile page where we get the user information (Note: This only happens if the user is logging in for the first time)
At dashboard the user can see their weekly progress in the form of chart which is made with the help of Chart.js. 
Scorling down we can see the the section with different cards of the workout specific to different body parts. On hitting anyone of those cards the user can do the workout diplayed in form of gif/mp4 with a timer and rest period included

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS A DATA SPECIFIC PROJECT WHERE THE GIF/MP4 VIDEOS HAVE NOT BEEN ADDED
THE CHART SECTION IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE BACKEND TO CHANGE AFTER EVERY WORKOUT

this is just a prototype
Thank You!
